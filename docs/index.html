  <p>Mora is a small package that makes adding RESTful services to
  Google App Engine models in Python easy.  Mora provides an interface
  inspired by Rails' routing actions but provides RESTful services
  similar to Facebook.  Specifically, resources are never nested and
  are always uniquely idenified by their ID.  This is an especially
  good match for app engine since Google's model identifiers contain
  both a table id and a model identifier encoded in a single id.</p>

  <p>The project
  is <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jdpalmer/mora">hosted on
  Bitbucket</a>, and the annotated source code
  for <a href="mora.db.html">mora.db</a>
  and <a href="mora.rest.html">mora.rest</a> is available in addition
  to this documention.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section">Basic Usage</h2>

  <p>Mora provides a nearly drop-in extension of Google's models.  It
  extends Google's models in a few ways including support for json
  model import and export.  In the simplest case, you can use this
  exactly like Google's db.Model:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums language-py">
from mora import db

class MyUserModel(db.MoraModel):

    google_user = db.UserProperty()

    join_date = db.DateTimeProperty(auto_now_add=True)</pre>

<p>You can then create RESTful services for User objects by creating a
rest handler:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums language-py">
from more.rest import RestHandler
from models import MyUserModel

class UserHandler(RestHandler)

    model = MyUserModel

    def show(self):
      self.respond.out.write(self.model.to_json())

    def update(self):
      self.model.from_json(self.params)
</pre>

  <p>and finally you can connect this handler to your main routing
  table:
  </p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums language-py">
import webapp2 as webapp
from mora.rest import RestDispatcher

import services

RestDispatcher.setup('/graph/', [services.UserHandler])

app = webapp.WSGIApplication(
    [('/', services.RootHandler),
     RestDispatcher.route()], debug = True)
</pre>

  <p>Now if <b>ag9kZXZ-YmVhbmdyaW5kZXJyCgsSBFVzZXIYAQw</b> was a User
  object id, we can get a json representation of that object with:</p>

  <pre>GET /graph/ag9kZXZ-YmVhbmdyaW5kZXJyCgsSBFVzZXIYAQw</pre>

  <p>and we can update the object by passing object properties as
  fields with:</p>

  <pre>PUT /graph/ag9kZXZ-YmVhbmdyaW5kZXJyCgsSBFVzZXIYAQw</pre>

  <h2 class="section">Implementing RESTful Actions</h2>

  <p>Mora's RestHandler has three named RESTful actions:</p>

  <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th><span class="caps">HTTP</span> Verb </th>
        <th>Path</th>
        <th>Action </th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="caps">GET</span>         </td>
        <td>/graph/:id        </td>
        <td>show</td>
        <td>display the object corresponding to :id.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="caps">PUT</span>         </td>
        <td>/graph/:id</td>
        <td>update</td>
        <td>update the object corresponding to :id.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="caps">DELETE</span>        </td>
        <td>/graph/:id</td>
        <td>destroy</td>
        <td>Remove the object corresponding to :id.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>The previous UserHandler example illustrated how you can
  implement these actions.  But you may notice something is missing.
  Our basic example does not include a way to add objects to the
  system or list objects.  Lets say that our user can have a list of
  clubs that they belong to.</p>

  <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th><span class="caps">HTTP</span> Verb </th>
        <th>Path</th>
        <th>Action </th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="caps">GET</span>         </td>
        <td>/graph/:id/clubs        </td>
        <td>index</td>
        <td>list the clubs that :id belongs to.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="caps">POST</span>         </td>
        <td>/graph/:id/clubs</td>
        <td>create</td>
        <td>add a club.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="caps">DELETE</span>        </td>
        <td>/graph/:id/clubs/:club_id</td>
        <td>destroy (weak)</td>
        <td>Remove :club_id from the list of clubs for :id.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>Implementing these actions involves using special method
  decorators.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums language-py">
from more.rest import RestHandler
from models import MyUserModel
from models import ClubModel

class UserHandler(RestHandler)

    model = MyUserModel

    def show(self):
        self.respond.out.write(self.model.to_json())

    def update(self):
        self.model.from_json(self.params)

    @rest_index("clubs")
    def club_list(self):
        clubs = []
        for club in ClubModel.all().fetch(1000):
            clubs.append(club.as_json())
        self.respond.out.writeln(json.dumps(clubs))

    @rest_create("clubs")
    def club_new(self):
        club = ClubModel()
        club.from_json(self.params)

    @rest_destroy("clubs")
    def club_remove(self):
        # TODO: Rework this into an example where it matters..
        pass

</pre>

  <h2 class="section">Customizing JSON output with as_json</h2>

  <p>In the examples so far, there is very little business logic.  The
  place to put it is in as_json.  Suppose we don't want to reveal the
  join_date when people query a User:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums language-py">
from mora import db

class MyUserModel(db.MoraModel):

    google_user = db.UserProperty()

    join_date = db.DateTimeProperty(auto_now_add=True)

    def as_json(self, options={}, include=None, exclude=None):
        return self._as_json(options, include, exclude=["join_date"])
</pre>

  <p>Easy peasy.</p>

  <h2 class="section">Fat Models and Django-style Model Referencing</h2>

  <p>Google's Model class is very much inspired by Django, but they
  left an important bit out that helps us get around circular
  dependencies in Python.  The following code just doesn't work:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums language-py">
class A(db.Model):

    b = db.ReferenceProperty(B)

class B(db.Model):

    a = db.ReferenceProperty(A)
</pre>

  <p>This circular dependency just won't work.  Mora adds back
  Django's solution:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums language-py">
class A(db.Model):

    b = db.ReferenceProperty("B")

class B(db.Model):

    a = db.ReferenceProperty("A")
</pre>

  <p>When all the classes are loaded these class strings get resolved
  to the right classes in a lookup table.</p>

  <h2 class="section">Computed Properties</h2>

  <p>Google app engine supports computed properties and we have simply
  extended them to also work with the new as_json methods and they
  also include type support.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums language-py">
class A(db.Model):

    @computed_property(StringProperty(default=""))
    def description(self):
        return "A is a model."
</pre>

  <p>Now if we run as_json on A, it will include description by
  default and it can also be used in GQL.</p>
